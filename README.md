# Iris recognition designed for post-mortem and diseased eyes

This software package demonstrates how to combine selected efforts aimed at delivering effective iris recognition methods for diseased eyes and post-mortem samples (collected after death). The following codes and models were merged here into a complete iris recognition software package:

# How to

## Matlab:
Simply run / analyze `howto.m` (tested with Matlab 2019b -- 2020b) to have fun.

## Python: 
1. Install dependecies:

```bash
conda env create -f ccnet.yaml
```

2. Run / analyze:
* `howto.py`, which - as an example - encodes and matches three post-mortem samples from the Warsaw dataset
* `howto_pair_with_visualization.py`, which demonstrates how to match a pair of images and get visualizations annotating salient regions within iris annulus

# Database

The Warsaw datasets of post-mortem iris images (acquired from 79 cadavers in total) can be requested at http://zbum.ia.pw.edu.pl/EN/node/46. Warsaw post-mortem iris datasets are freely available for non-commercial purposes to all interested researchers.
